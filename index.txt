About me

I am a Machine Learning Research Engineer from Paris, France, with a strong foundation in multimodality, deep learning, computer vision, and natural language processing. I enjoy turning complex, real-world challenges into robust and efficient AI-powered solutions.

My work involves the end-to-end development of intelligent systems, from data engineering and model architecture to optimization and deployment. My aim is to leverage state-of-the-art research to build models that can understand and interact with the world in more nuanced ways. I have had the opportunity to lead research and development on cutting-edge multimodal AI projects.
